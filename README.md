Files:
- index.html

To view locally:
1. Open PowerShell in this folder
2. Run a simple HTTP server:

Python 3:
```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Or use the included script:
```
python serve.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser.

Next steps:
- Replace placeholders with your renderings, floorplans and the investor PDF.
- Update copy, contact details and the proforma numbers.
- If you want I can add a downloadable investor deck button that serves a real PDF and/or integrate a simple NDA gate before downloading.
